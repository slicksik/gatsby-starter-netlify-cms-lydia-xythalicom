I was born in Athens, Greece in 1988. I have a love for post-punk, Seinfeld, spicy Bloody Marys and extremely hot peppers.



For the past 12 years, I’ve worked as an EFL teacher and content writer for Cyclops Web. I wrote my first storybook at 6 - complete with illustrations!\

I still stand by that sentiment today. I still write all the time. It’s the only thing that makes sense. I write harder when I’m in trouble. And I’m in trouble quite often, the good kind or otherwise.

In March 2019, my personal essay The Kobayashi Maru For Queers was published in NASTY! VOL. 2. Eight months later, my first fiction story Parasiteland was included in BLEAK FRIDAY. I am currently working on a novella, but don’t quote me on that.
