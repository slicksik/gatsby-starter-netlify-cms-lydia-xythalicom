    I was born in Athens, Greece in 1988. I have a love for post-punk, Seinfeld,
    spicy Bloody Marys

    and extremely hot peppers.


    For the past 12 years, I’ve worked as an EFL teacher and content writer for
    Cyclops Web.

    I wrote my first storybook at 6 - complete with illustrations! It was about
    a benevolent community

    of snakes who break into people’s homes en masse to terrorize them, so as to
    put an end to

    being skinned for shoes and bags. I still stand by that sentiment today. I
    still write all the time.

    It’s the only thing that makes sense. I write harder when I’m in trouble.
    And I’m in trouble quite

    often, the good kind or otherwise.

  In March 2019, my personal essay The Kobayashi Maru For Queers was published
  in NASTY! VOL. 2. Eight months later, my first fiction story Parasiteland was
  included in BLEAK FRIDAY. I am currently working on a novella, but don’t quote
  me on that.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
